Amtrak Central Division Inter-Office Communication System

The Amtrak Central Division Inter-Office Communication System is a custom browser
based web application that provides efficient messaging for Transportation Department
employees.

Users communicate by sending files and text messages to each other.  Each message can be
sent to one or more users.  A recipient can acknowledge messages with one click of the mouse
so the sender will have a receipt that a message has been read.

Users log on to the system with a username and password. All actions are timestamped and priveleged users will
have the ability conduct reviews.
